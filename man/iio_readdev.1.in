iio_readdev \- read buffers from an IIO device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B iio_readdev

[-n <hostname>] [-t <trigger>] [-T <timeout-ms>] [-b <buffer-size>] [-s <samples>] <iio_device> [<channel> ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B iio_reg
is a utility for reading buffers from connected IIO devices, and sending resutls to standard out.

.SH OPTIONS
##COMMON_COMMANDS_START##
##COMMON_COMMANDS_STOP##
.TP
.B \-t \-\-trigger
Use the specified trigger, if needed on the specified channel
.TP
.B \-b \-\-buffer-size
Size of the capture buffer. Default is 256.
.TP
.B \-s \-\-samples
Number of samples (not bytes) to capture, 0 = infinite. Default is 0.
.TP
.B \-T \-\-timeout
Buffer timeout in milliseconds. 0 = no timeout. Default is 0.
##COMMON_OPTION_START##
##COMMON_OPTION_STOP##
.SH RETURN VALUE
If the specified device is not found, a non-zero exit code is returned.

.SH "USAGE"
.PP 
You use iio_readdev in the same way you use many of the other libiio utilities.
You must specify a IIO device, and the specific channel to read. Since this is a read, channels must be input.
It is easy to use
.B iio_attr
to find out what the channels are called.
.PP
This identifies the device, and channel that can be used.
